# Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Disaster Management
UAV-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with optional Quantum Optimization (QAOA) components.

This repository provides a modular, reproducible implementation accompanying the manuscript
"Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Disaster Management: A UAV-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Quantum Optimization Approach".

The code is built to run immediately on a standard machine using a lightweight toy environment. Adapters and templates are provided for AirSim, ns-3, and quantum backends.

## Features
- CTDE-style MARL scaffolding (PyTorch).
- Example QMIX implementation for cooperative tasks.
- Toy Gym-like environment for rapid prototyping and reproducibility.
- QAOA solver wrapper (Qiskit, simulator backend by default) and hybrid optimizer interface.
- Logging (TensorBoard compatible), checkpointing, and configuration via YAML.
- Dockerfile for reproducible environment.

## Quickstart (toy environment)
1. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
